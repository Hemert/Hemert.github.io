## About me
Hi, I am Martin van Hemert (25). I study Biology and Medical Research at Avans University of Applied Sciences in Breda. I am currently doing a graduation internship at the Erasmus MC Dept. of Neurosurgery. During this internship I am involved in the repurposing of drugs for the treatment of Glioblastoma.
